# STOCK MARKET RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM


### OBJECTIVE:

The aim of the project is to create a stock market recommendation system that can successfully predict the next day movement of stock prices. The expected movement of the stock price can help us maximise our profits.

<br />

### TOOLS USED:

TensorFlow

GitHub

Jenkins

<br />

### DATA COLLECTION:

The data is collected for the stock prices of Apple (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance. The periods have been taken in accordance to the feasibility of features available.

<br />

### IMPLEMENTATION:

The input data is split into training and test datasets; the forecasting models will be fit on the training dataset, and the accuracy of the fit will be evaluated on the test dataset. Once the models are fit to the training data, they can be used to predict the stock price for subsequent days using the information regarding previous day stock prices and the news sentiment.
